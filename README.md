# Urban Living,  mobile application

# Some words
The client wants three versions of a news application. The [visitors interface](https://github.com/kfrostare-Newsroom/newsroom_team2_news_app), the [admin interface](https://github.com/kfrostare-Newsroom/newsroom_team2_internal) and a [mobile application](https://github.com/kfrostare-Newsroom/newsroom_team2_mobile) plus of course a [API](https://github.com/kfrostare-Newsroom/newsroom_team2_api).

# The MVP product
**The MVP product will include a way for a visitor to:**
* view a list of articles
